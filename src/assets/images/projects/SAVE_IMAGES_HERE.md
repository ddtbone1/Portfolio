# HOW TO ADD YOUR SCREENSHOTS

## The Problem:
Your project images aren't showing because they need to be saved as actual image files.

## Solution - Save Your Screenshots:

### Step 1: Save the POS Screenshot
1. Right-click on your **Marty's Karenderia** screenshot
2. Choose "Save image as..."
3. Save it as: `pos-screenshot.png`
4. Location: `src/assets/images/projects/pos-screenshot.png`

### Step 2: Save the CRM Screenshot  
1. Right-click on your **SimpleCRM Dashboard** screenshot
2. Choose "Save image as..."
3. Save it as: `crm-screenshot.png`
4. Location: `src/assets/images/projects/crm-screenshot.png`

### Step 3: Update the Code
After saving the images, update Projects.jsx to import them:

```jsx
// Replace the data URLs with actual imports:
import posScreenshot from '../assets/images/projects/pos-screenshot.png'
import crmScreenshot from '../assets/images/projects/crm-screenshot.png'
```

## Quick Fix:
For now, placeholder images are showing. Once you save your actual screenshots with the exact file names above, they'll automatically appear!

## File Structure Should Be:
```
src/assets/images/projects/
├── pos-screenshot.png (Your Marty's Karenderia image)
└── crm-screenshot.png (Your SimpleCRM dashboard image)
```
